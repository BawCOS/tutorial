This example document shows how you can embed interactive Python exercises in your R Markdown files.

Suppose you want to explain people how variable assignment works in Python. Create an exercise with a certain identifier, `create_a` in this case. Then, in different Python code chunks, specify the elements of the exercise by setting the `type` inside the code chunk options.

```{python, ex="create_a", type="pre-exercise-code"}
# This code is available in the workspace when the session initializes
b = 5
```

```{python, ex="create_a", type="sample-code"}
# Create a variable a, equal to 5

```

```{python, ex="create_a", type="solution"}
# Create a variable a, equal to 5
a = 5
```

```{python, ex="create_a", type="sct"}
test_object("a")
success_msg("Great!")
```

```{python, ex="create_a", type="hint"}
Here is a hint: use `=` for assignment
```
